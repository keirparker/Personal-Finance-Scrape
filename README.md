# Personal-Finance-Scrape

Quick and Easy Python code created to track personal finances in a combination of web scraping and platform API's.
I used Selenium to scrape Money Dashboard (total balance across all bank accounts) and Hargreaves Lansdown(total balance across accounts). I use Coinbase's API to then track the balance of my cryptocurrency wallet and email a little report to myself.

Told you it was quick and easy. 
I've automated this using task scheduler, but may move to AWS at some point in the future.
